Application of Supervised learning algorithms for solving different problems


Projekat1 is about prediction of concentration of PM2.5 particle in the air.
Model were trained by using Linear Regression.

Project2 is about classification of culinary recipes.
Classification models were trained by using knn classificator and logistic regression.
After the training models were tested.
The best models for each classificator were saved.


Hand classification problem was solved with application of algorithms neural networks, k-nearest neighbors and random forest.
